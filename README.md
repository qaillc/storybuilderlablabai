# Story Builder Lablab.ai GPT Hackathon Submission Nov 23, 2023
Project Title: World Builders

Short Description: Creating a world memory palace to enhance learning for AWS cloud exams.

Long Description: The core idea is to aid individuals preparing for AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud certification exams. The GPT model is trained to transform standard multiple-choice questions from the AWS exams into engaging narratives set within a personalized fantasy world created by the user. This world is inhabited by a hero character who encounters and solves these exam-related problems as part of their adventures.

By integrating complex cloud concepts into a dynamic and imaginative story, the user is not merely memorizing facts but experiencing them. This experiential learning approach is hypothesized to significantly enhance retention and recall abilities, as the user forms strong associative memories between the material and their crafted world.

The GPT-driven "World Memory Palace" thus aims to revolutionize the way learners approach exam preparation, transforming it from a tedious task into an interactive and memorable journey through a world of their own design.
